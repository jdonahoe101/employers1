						Human resources professionals are in the business of people. Unfortunately, it’s all-too-easy to get caught up in the day-to-day minutiae of retirement plans, PTO logs, and annual reviews, at the expense of initiatives that engage and motivate staff. How can you establish a work environment that offers more than just a paycheck — the kind of place where every employee is motivated to give their best? Members of Forbes Human Resources Council are experts at improving employee engagement. We’ve rounded up some of their top tips to improve how you attract, train and retain talent. Attract Top Talent Creating value for employees begins with the hiring process. Building an organization full of top-tier talent, with a corporate culture that emphasizes what’s in it for them, is the cornerstone of an employee value proposition. Here are a few tips to get it right. 1. Be authentic “Don't put on a show to snag a candidate,” says Sara Whitman, managing director and chief culture czar at Peppercomm. “It's critical the candidate knows exactly what he or she is walking into and can make a smart decision about the future. The only way to know if it is a fit is for both parties to have open eyes and clarity.” Read 11 other Forbes Human Resources Council members’ top hiring tips. 2. Think like a marketer “ You're selling jobs and you want the best buyers. Think like a marketer to attract top talent ,” says Jennifer Marszalek, chief talent officer of Havas Chicago. “The pitch: why should someone want to work at your organization, what will they get out of it? Next, the campaign: Ensure the people you want know how to find you. Last, focus on your reputation: What do people see when they look up your organization? Work to ensure what they see is what you intend.” Check out 11 more resolutions for attracting talent in 2018. 3. Write your EVP from the candidate perspective “As you craft your EVP, make sure you answer the job seeker's No. 1 question: ‘What's in it for me?’” says Peter K. Murdock, VP of recruiting for Blackmoon Mooring. “If your answer can speak effectively to the type of candidate your company needs to fill that role, you have a winning EVP.” Take a look at two EVP examples Peter has crafted. 4. Welcome all types of workers “To remain competitive, employers today must adapt to today’s flexible labor market, hiring a mix of full-time, part-time and gig workers,” says Jocelyn Mangan, COO at Snagajob. “Employers shouldn’t respond to a low unemployment rate the way they did in the past — simply offering higher salaries. Paying workers a competitive wage always makes good business sense, but workers today value control over their schedules as much as they do fair pay. By offering many different shifts, employers can attract a diverse workforce. One-size-fits-all hiring is a thing of the past.” Read her full report on attracting workers in a flexible labor market. Get To Know Your Employees Once you have a stable of excellent employees, be sure to get to know them so that you understand what motivates each person individually and how to help them do their best. Here are some thoughts on the best ways to get acquainted. 5. Manage like a mentor According to Charece Newell, vice president of human resources for Sunspire Health, “ To get to know your employees better, you must manage like a mentor. Mentorship allows you to have a different relationship with your employees. The employee will view you as a thought leader, someone who cares about their career, and they will feel more supported. With your trusted guidance, they will be inspired to share more with you. Mentoring will keep them motivated as you lead with purpose.” Read nine more “getting-to-know-you” suggestions from Council members. 6. Make a human connection (with technology) When some (or all) of your employees are remote, you have to be more purposeful in creating connection. Vivian Maza, chief people officer of Ultimate Software, suggests “using tools that make coworkers feel like they’re next door, rather than across the state. Instant messaging, video conferencing and virtual hangouts are becoming more popular and can be equally effective for collaboration among teams. Video calls are an easy way to keep meetings face-to-face, even at a distance.” Check out her other ideas for keeping remote workers engaged.

					<h4 class="title">Conclusions</h4>
					<p>Train Them Well Now that you know what makes your employees tick, you’ll want to ensure that excellent training enables them to continue performing at the top of their fields. 7. Create a strategic, agile and engaging plan for employee training Suzanne Hyatt, chief people officer at RhythmOne, recently discussed three crucial facets of a successful employee training program. “Move away from the one-and-done approach to learning and toward an ‘always on’ vehicle for learning that can quickly pivot and adapt to meet changing needs. Mobile learning is always on and accessible, while microlearning allows for short bursts of learning that are easily and quickly digested and can be quickly pivoted to address new topics and purposes.” Read her complete analysis of ways companies can drive engagement with learning. 8. Onboard new technology by clearly delineating the benefits “Technology means change,” says Bridgette Wilder of Wilder HR Management & EEO Consulting. “For successful change, share with employees why the technology is being implemented, and how it will benefit the employee in doing their job and enhancing their skills. Show them how they can to contribute to the change, and what the identified ROI is post-implementation. By doing this, employees will feel valued and have greater buy-in for future changes.” Consider eight more strategies for keeping employees on top of new technology. Provide Great Leadership Of course, even when you’ve got a great team, you’ve spent time getting to know them, and you’ve trained them well, you still must provide excellent leadership to complete the package. Implement the strategies below, proposed by Forbes Human Resources Council members, to set yourself and your company apart: 9. Listen, listen, and listen some more Jared Narlock, VP of talent development at Regional Health, says “I often think I’m helping my team by sharing my thoughts and I forget that it’s more beneficial if I listen to them and use their preferred communication style to ask questions. ... Work to not solve problems for them, but instead listen and guide them toward their own solutions. It will help them grow and they’ll appreciate that you made the time about them.” Read the full post on three things employees are looking for from leaders. 10. Keep your team informed Be certain that you’re not unintentionally stressing out your most valuable assets. Ivelices Thomas, head of human resources and compliance for GardaWorld U.S. Cash Services, warns that “Withholding information from your team is one of the most detrimental things you can do to workplace productivity. Communication is a key driver for employee engagement, and when employees aren’t connected to a clear vision of where they are going and what they need to contribute to get there, they will lack purpose in their work. ... So use every opportunity to engage in meaningful interactions with your team, always communicating openly and honestly.” Check out the five things you may be doing to stress out your employees—and how to stop. A company is built of and for people. Take advantage of these tips to make all the difference for your employees, and by extension, your business.

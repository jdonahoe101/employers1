                    <p>One of the many challenges of business owners today is to attract and retain key employees with comprehensive benefit programs. Many employees not only assume but expect large company style benefits, which can not only be costly to a business owner, but may not even be available. Obtaining and administering these benefits programs can be a significant cost to your business as well as lost time. Finding the right benefits program can give your company the competitive edge.</p>

By the way, we have full-time recruiters to assist with your talent acquisition needs.</p>
                    <p> We offer multiple major medical group policies that will fit your organization's needs and budget. If by the off chance we do not offer one that fits your needs then we will work with your existing plan. Our package of benefits also includes dental, vision, both long-term and short-term disability, life insurance, and a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Our Section 125 cafeteria plan allows many of these benefits to be pre-tax, and your organization will have access to our 401k retirement plan, typically with no additional cost.</p>

                    <p>One of the many challenges of business owners today is to attract and retain key employees. This is even harder without a comprehensive benefit program in place for them. Many employees not only assume, but expect large company style benefits. These benefits can not only be costly to a business owner, but may not even be available.Obtaining and administering these benefits programs can be a significant cost to your business as well as lost time. Finding the right benefits program can give your company the competitive edge. EOSG is able to provide you with this competitive edge with our flexible benefits programs. EOSG will work with you to design an affordable yet comprehensive benefit program that will meet your business needs.
